<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">This example is a PHP site created with WEBDEV for managing blogs.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">A blog is a log or a diary on an Internet site. </span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">It can be consulted by everyone and everyone can write his own comments.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">The author of the blog writes messages whenever he wants to.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">You have the ability to format the text, to include images, notes, and so on.</span>

<span style="font-family:Arial sans-serif;font-size:14px;">Furthermore, each blog can be exported in RSS.</span>
